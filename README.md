###### Description 
	For my final project for BE188 at UCLA I designed and created a music reactive lamp. The following sections below will provide enough information to create the product yourself. The user has the ability to control the brightness of the lamp through a potentiometer. The user also has the ability to switch modes from music reactive light to plain white light and vice versa through a switch button. The lamp also displays the day and time through an LCD screen.  

###### Materials
	Arduino Uno
	Breadboard
	Jumper Wires
	16X2 LCD Screen
	Switch Button
	Potentiometer
	RTC Clock + 2032B 3V battery

###### Future Improvements 
-	Power Arduino Uno from 5v power source instead of micro usb.
